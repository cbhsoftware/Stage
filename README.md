The best music bot for your server in 2023!

# Introduction

Rush is a music Discord bot created and coded in Java by CBHSoftware! It's currently in Beta and we don't know when we're going to release it.

After the shutdown of Rythm and Groovy (some of Discord's BEST music bots at the time) we decided to step in and we made Rush.
